The EcoGRAPH research team is partnering with Southern Nazarene University and the NASA Globe Program to bring a new citizen science opportunity to Oklahoma! We are recruiting citizen scientists of all ages who are interested in contributing to our understanding of mosquito biology and ecology and want to help make Oklahoma safe from mosquito-borne disease. Volunteer scientists will use make observations around their homes and use NASAâ€™s GLOBE Observer (GO) free mobile app to contribute their observations. Organizational meetings will be held at the following times and locations:
