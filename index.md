**<font size = "5">We are recruiting postdoctoral research associates to join our team and work on two exciting new projects: 1) Drought, Fire, and Forest Carbon Dyanmics in West Africa, and 2) Urban Microclimates and Disease Transmission in India.

The EcoGRAPH team is in the Department of [Geography and Environmental Sustainability](http://www.ou.edu/ags/geography) at the [University of Oklahoma](http://www.ou.edu/). Our research explores the impacts of changing climate and landscapes on ecosystems and human health, with an emphasis on developing spatial decision support tools to support public health decisions, land use planning, and natural resource management. We address these topics through landscape, regional, and global analyses using satellite remote sensing and other sources of environmental monitoring data. Specific research areas include the effects of environmental change on vector-borne disease outbreaks, the influences of human land use and wildfires on forest landscape dynamics, the impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification on native ecosystems, and the development of computer software for disease outbreak forecasting and landscape change modeling. We conduct our research in locations throughout the world including North America, West Africa, Ethiopia, and India.
